// Exercise 14: Write a function named 'mergeArrays' that takes two arrays and returns a new array that combines the elements of both arrays, alternating between them.

function mergeArrays(arr1, arr2) {
  return [...arr1, ...arr2].sort();
}

console.log(mergeArrays([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6])); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
